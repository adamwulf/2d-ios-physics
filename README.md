[Spare Parts](http://www.sparepartsapp.com) is a 2D physics game that lets you build silly contraptions and machines. The goal for this project is:

 - 100% of the code is open source in this repo
 - 100% of the development is livestreamed
 - Version 1.0 will be finished within 2 weeks and submitted to the App Store
 
Development started on March 23rd, and the app was submitted on April 5th!

The app is now on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spare-parts/id981297199?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4).
